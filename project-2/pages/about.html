   <h1>Baking and Me</h1>
   <div id="Why I Like Baking">
     <p>I have found an excuss to bake for any occation. Not particularly because I enjoy eating bad foods, but because everyone that eats my treats seem to enjoy them more than myself.
     For me, it is both the process and then sharing. I enjoy the actual process of baking, for example, mixing the ingredients and experimenting with all types of recipes.
   There are some recipes I have come across that I enjoy making so much that I no longer need to measure ingredients. But what really makes me pationate about baking is being able to
 share my creations and see someone else enjoy them as well.</p>
   </div>
   <div id="Favorite Cakes">
     <p>Simplicity is key, especially when I bake. I enjoy the easy simple cake creations the best. My favorite cakes are either chocolate or vanilla.
     Once in a while my taste buds have me wanting something a little more interesting, like a cookie dough cheese cake.
   But most of the time I perfer to enjoy the simple vanilla or chocolate.  </p>

   <div id="How to Learn More">
     <p> For those who wish to start baking or those who want to continue trying new recipes, I would suggest turning on the food network or going to a local baking class.
     Of course, there are always the simpler way to learn more and that is to google baking hacks to see what kind of tips might be helpful for you. There are so many recipes out there,
   just start baking! </p>
