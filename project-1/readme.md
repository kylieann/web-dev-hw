# technical report

I mostly use safari and google chrome for my browser of choice. We use web browsers everyday, but the way a browser functions is very interesting. A rendering engine is responsible for interpreting html and css content. Javascript is the programming language that is used, which is translated through interpreters. There a multiple engines that help correspond with the way browsers function. The rendering engine reads the html and contracts a DOM (document object model). These are all passed by the engine and once it has been constructed, it is ready to be interactive.

I used chrome to locate the Wayback Machine Website. I chose to search nfl.com into the search bar, which brought me to a bunch of years, indicating what their website looked like during that time period. I scrolled down to May 29, 1998 and clicked the date, showing me exactly what the website looked like during that day in time. The website now gives you a lot more information than it did in 1998. The website back then was very easily navigated and did not have nearly the amount of resources it does now.

My work cycle for this assignment went better than I thought it was going to go. The only problem I came across was getting a picture to go along with my poem. I realized it was difficult to detected how many pixels the photo has, which is why it took me longer to complete that stage. Once I had a small enough pixel photo, it was smooth sailing from there. So far I havenâ€™t posted any of my problems to the issues board because I have been able to figure out the solutions myself.
