The difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans is that divs are used to wrap sections of work together. Spans and divs kind of go hand in hand because spans can only be used to wrap some portions of your work inside of divs sections. Classes and ids are also one in the same, except an id is specific for one page. Only one element can use one ID. If it is a class, this would mean that different elements can share the same class. Instead of only having one element for a class, you can use multiple classes on the same element.

You might consider a third-party over self-hosted media because the codes are written out in advanced and you do not have to code every part yourself, making your job a lot easier. Another reason might be because third-party consists of a much smaller file, allowing you to upload ideas/webpages a lot faster than if you were to use self-hosted media. You also might be charged a lot more if you are using a self-hosting media, while it is cheaper using third-party options.

For my work cycle this week, a lot of different techniques were learned in coding. Because I struggled last week, I made sure I read everything exactly as it was stated to make sure I stayed on track. It is always easy for me to get frustrated when I canâ€™t figure something out, so rereading and understanding why something was working helped me along with this assignment. I am pleased that I did not struggle with this assignment as much as the last one.
